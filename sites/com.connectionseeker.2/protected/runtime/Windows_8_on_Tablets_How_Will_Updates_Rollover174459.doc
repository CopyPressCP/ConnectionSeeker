<div><span><strong>Article Content: </strong></span><br /><span><p>The release of Windows 8 is just around the corner, and the latest update to the Windows operating system is already getting mixed reviews. If you’re currently a Windows 7 user, you’re probably wondering if the update is worth it and how to go about upgrading your tablet to Windows 8.</p>

<h2>What’s the Big Deal about Windows 8?</h2>
<p>The big question on everyone’s mind is if this latest OS from Microsoft can really live up to the hype it’s generating. From the looks of it, the answer may very possibly be a resounding yes. But just what’s different about Windows 8?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Metro user interface.</strong> Keeping up with Android and Apple, Microsoft has integrated an all new user interface into Windows 8 with a bigger focus on apps and simple navigation.</li>
<li><strong>Simple syncing across devices.</strong> Tablets, PCs, and smartphones that run Windows 8 will seamlessly integrate with each other to keep all of your user details up to date.</li>
<li><strong>Faster and more efficient.</strong> While Windows 8 is packed with new features, Microsoft has still managed to improve the operating system’s performance. It loads and operates just a bit faster than its predecessor, all while using less power to conserve battery life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not everyone is enthusiastic about the new Metro UI, but it could just be a matter of adjusting to such a big change in the traditional Windows layout. The tablet-like sensors that will be integrated into most new <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/laptop/ultrabook/">Windows 8 Ultrabooks</a> may boost the OS’s appeal, at least slightly. Light sensors, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and GPS locators will make laptops and ultrabooks even more functional.</p>
<h2>When Can We Expect It?</h2>

<p>A preview version of Windows 8 is already available as a free download for PCs, but the retail launch of the Microsoft OS is planned for later in the year. Manufacturers will receive their version in August, according to the company, and the consumer copy should be on the market by late October. Windows 8 tablets and computers will start to emerge around this time as well.</p>
<h2>How to Update to Windows 8</h2>
<p>PC owners who are currently running Windows 7 - or still operating on XP - can upgrade to Windows 8 for just $14.99 when it is released in October. Unfortunately, the Windows 7 phone cannot update to the latest version.</p>

<p>If you want to update your tablet to Windows 8, it may prove to be more difficult than you would think. Tablets and portable PCs that currently run an older version of Windows should be able to upgrade the OS like a desktop.</p>
<p>Windows 8 RT is a new addition to the Microsoft OS family and is designed to power tablets with ARM processors, like Androids and iPads. Each installation of the RT version requires a custom installation, however, so it isn’t a very simple upgrade.</p>
<p>Nearly three dozen different tablets and ultrabooks are already in the making to coincide with the launch of Windows 8.</p>

<p>If you’re not in the market for a new computer or tablet, but would rather not upgrade to Windows 8 quite yet, you still have some time with your older operating systems. XP will no longer be supported after April of 2014.</p>
