<div><span><strong>Article Content: </strong></span><br /><span><p>When it comes to air travel, there are three ways of getting the tablet PC or laptop to your destination: shipping, carrying the laptop with you, and checking it in.</p>
<h2>Shipping</h2>

<p>When preparing to ship a laptop or tablet, whether it's an iPad, <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/laptop/ultrabook/">lightweight Ultrabook</a>, netbook, or e-book reader, it's best to invest in a box that is made specifically to ship laptops and tablet PCs. </p>
<p>If this isn't an option, here's what you'll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A plastic bag</li>
<li>Bubble wrap</li>
<li>Packing peanuts</li>
<li>Box (2 to 3 times bigger than the item)</li>
<li>Packing tape</li>
</ul>
<p>First, wrap the item in a plastic bag, which will protect it from dust and the other packing materials. Next, wrap it in bubble wrap and tape closed with packing tape. Surround it with packing peanuts on all sides so that the peanuts fill all available room and it's tightly packed. Close the box and tape closed. </p>
<h2>Packing in Carry On Bag</h2>

<p>The next option for bringing a tablet PC with you while traveling is to bring it onto the plane in your carry on luggage. There are quite a few advantages to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You'll have it with you to use before boarding and while flying.</li>
<li>Because it's with you at all times, you know that it's safe.</li>
<li>There's less chance it could be lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
<p>When packing your tablet, make sure it's in a place where it can be removed easily. Although tablets are not often required to be removed from luggage, it's possible that you'll be asked to remove it while going through security, so you'll want to be able to access it easily. </p>
<h2>Packing in Checked Bag</h2>

<p>The next option is to pack your tablet PC in a bag that you'll check. This should be avoided if at all possible. There are however times when checking in a tablet might be the only option. Here are some things you can do to secure your laptop or tablet PC.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a rugged case that covers and protects your laptop.</li>
<li>Before leaving on the trip, back up any important information with either external hard drives or using a backup site online.</li>
<li>Password protect your laptop and private information.</li>
<li>Consider getting a TSA-approved lock for your bags that can only be opened by TSA officers and yourself.</li>
<li>Add a program like Prey or LoJack for Laptops to protect your information and help locate it if it gets stolen.</li>
</ul>
<p>By taking these precautions, your tablet or laptop will more likely arrive at its destination without being worse for the wear. </p>
<h2>Do You Need to Pack Your Tablet?</h2>

<p>Another thing to consider before leaving on your trip is whether you'll really need the tablet. If you're headed on vacation and have a smartphone, more than likely it will do whatever you need, including responding to email, finding your way around the destination, browsing the Web, keeping connected with friends and family via social networking sites, and listening to music. </p>
<p>If you can avoid bringing it with you, consider just leaving it at home. Then you won't have to worry about how to pack it or whether it will make it to and from your destination safely.</p>
