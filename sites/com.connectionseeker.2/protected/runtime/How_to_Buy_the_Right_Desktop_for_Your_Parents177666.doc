<body><div><span><strong>Article Title:</strong> </span><span>How to Buy the Right Desktop for Your Parents</span></div><br />
<div><span><strong>Article Content: </strong></span><br /><span><div>A desktop computer may be the perfect gift to give your parents. That is, it may be if you can choose a model for them. Some older individuals are super Internet savvy. They can even tell you how to use the latest social media sites. Then there are those parents who may not know what Word is, much less what the difference between Safari and Google is. Choosing the right desktop means really focusing in on the features, unless you want to spend every waking minute <a href="http://www.teachparentstech.org/">answering questions</a>.</div>

<h2>Simple Is Good</h2>

<div>For the <a href="http://www.experienceproject.com/question-answer/Do-Your-Parents-Understand-Modern-Technology-(Cell-PhoneComputer-Ect)/1160002">less than savvy computer users</a>, it's best to keep things simple. That means reducing the number of programs and focusing instead on the features they really need. This may include a simple-to-use browser, for example. The more complex it is, the more difficult the learning curve. Even if you have all of the patience in the world, teaching your parents how to use Excel's formulas may frustrate them quickly. In other words, you want your parents really to enjoy using the computer. Don't make it too hard to use.</div>

<h2>The Form Options</h2>

<div>There are options in the desktop design. You could go with something like a <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/tablet/">fast and reliable tablet</a> or you could select a compact desktop instead. On the other hand, an all-in-one design may be ideal. Which is right for your parents? Buy what they need and keep use of it easy. Touchscreens are nice, especially if typing is too difficult for arthritic hands. However, those who don't like those features are going to want what they know, such as a keyboard that reminds them of a typewriter. Look at form options carefully to ensure comfort of the user.</div>
<p> </p>
<h2>Give Them What They Need</h2>

<div>What do your parents intend to do with their desktop? The options are endless of course. Perhaps they are tech savvy enough to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> with their best buddies. On the other hand, they may interested in no more than playing Farmville on Facebook. Most older adults benefit from access to email, a browser, a way to store pictures, a writing program and a chat tool such as Skype. That's all they need to get the most out of a desktop. Tailor your buying decision towards the features your parents will really use. Cut out the other stuff.</div>
<p> </p>
<h2>Don't Hold Them Back</h2>

<div>Some older adults love learning new technology. They want to dive in to learn formatting to create their own website. They want to have video editing software and couldn't live without a few blog templates to call their own. The bottom line here is not to purchase a desktop computer that's too limited for the older adult who loves this type of connectivity. Not only will you insult them, but it's not a worthwhile investment.</div>
<p>The right desktop for your parents is the one that provides a connection to the Internet the way they want it. Don't limit them, but at the same time, don't over buy. If your parents aren't too tech savvy, don't buy something too complex for you to even use.</p>
