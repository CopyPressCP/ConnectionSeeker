<p>CNet calls the Asus Transformer Pad “the best premium Android tablet,” but Top 10 Reviews ranks it midway through the list, pointing out that WiFi is essential for internet connectivity.

<li>Slow app response time</li>
</ul>
<h2>So Which is Right for You?</h2>
<p>Which tablet is the right one for you? It depends on your personal preferences and what you’ll be using your tablet PC for primarily. Some models are well-equipped for photo and video sharing and streaming, while others offer more productivity compatibility, such as the ability to edit and update Microsoft Office documents and files.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something lightweight and easy to transport that will allow you to browse the internet and participate in your social networks, you’ll need less advanced functionality than other users. Tablets are generally not well-known for word processing capabilities, but there are some tablet PCs that offer users the ability to edit this type of file.</p>
<p>Beyond applications, the best tablet for you will depend on your travel needs. If you’re a user who will be spending hours away from the office while you need to be connected, look for features like a long battery life and additional hard drive storage for larger project management tasks.</p>
