<div><span><strong>Article Content: </strong></span><br /><span><p>Laptop users know how frustrating it can be when a laptop battery runs down. As the battery gets closer to being drained, all kinds of things start going wrong and data can be lost. Some people buy extended life batteries to solve the problem, but all that really winds up doing is putting it off for a couple of more hours. If you want to optimize your laptop battery life, then there are plenty of things you can do.</p>
<h2>Battery Conservation Settings</h2>

<p>Every <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/us/en/" target="_blank">laptop</a> operating system has energy saving features that will allow you to conserve battery power. Some settings include reducing the brightness of the screen and shutting down multimedia features that you may not be using, such as the web camera. Take some time to become familiar with your laptop's power conservation features by reading the user's manual.</p>
<h2>Backup Equipment</h2>

<p>Planning ahead is often the best way to <a href="http://www.friedbeef.com/top-15-ways-to-extend-your-laptop-battery-life/">combat inconvenient power issues</a> with your laptop. For example, carry a high-speed battery charger and a spare battery in your laptop carrying case. Then you will always have a spare battery ready and a way to charge the depleted battery back to life. </p>
<h2>Background Programs</h2>

<p>People often do not realize how much power a laptop draws when it is asked to constantly run background programs. Antivirus programs, calendar programs and CPU usage programs are examples of programs that run on your laptop without you realizing it. If you are not connected to the Internet, then you do not need to run your antivirus program. Go through your operating system to see which background programs are running and turn off the programs you are not using.</p>
<h2>More RAM</h2>

<p>When your laptop has more memory, then it does not need to keep using the hard drive or CPU to get information. If you want to conserve power on your laptop, then install the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">maximum amount of RAM</a>.</p>
<h2>Cooling</h2>

<p>The hotter your laptop gets, the more energy it uses to run its fans. You can help your laptop stay cool by utilizing a laptop cooling pad for any surface, including your lap. Because of the way laptops are designed, most laptop vents are near the bottom of the computer. Avoid putting your laptop on a blanket or anything that can wrap around it and cause it to heat up. You should also use your laptop in a clean, dust-free environment to prevent the vents from getting clogged and making the fans have to work harder.</p>
<p>We all know that, at some point, our laptop battery is going to run out. To prevent it from running out at critical moments, you need to take the necessary steps to optimize your laptop battery power.</p>
