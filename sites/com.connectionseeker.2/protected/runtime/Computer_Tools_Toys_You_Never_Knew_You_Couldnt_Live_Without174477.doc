<div><span><strong>Article Content: </strong></span><br /><span><p>Gadgets and gizmos are the modern day equivalent of fire. Walk by a store that sells computers, cell phones, and the like, and you'll see people bent over machines, eyes ablaze, as they make discovery after discovery. Just when it seems technological advances are heralding the dawning of a new era, the toys that are the hallmark of geek culture keep you grounded.</p>

<p>Transform your traditional wall socket into an outlet with two USB charging ports by installing U-Socket USB Wallplug.  Admittedly, it’s not as attention-getting as the farting pen, but this  device will save time and headaches. Lots of devices such as <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/tablet/ideapad/">Tablet PCs used in an office</a> or smartphones that require juice from a traditional outlet, but can also  charge with a USB cable. So, imagine taking an existing outlet and  creating two plug-in spaces for USB cables. When time is short to charge  your gadgets, this innovation is a lifesaver.</p>

<p>While this isn't really a computer tool, it will still make working at your desk a lot less monotonous and boring. The  Pull My Finger Fart Pen is, as the name implies, a finger-shaped pen  that, when pulled, makes a fart sound. In addition to the gag, the pen  actually works. However, it’s unclear where anyone would feel  comfortable writing with a farting finger.</p>
<h2>Hidden CPU Holder</h2>

<p>That’s not a typo. It’s a CPU holder, not a CUP holder. This handy device attaches underneath a desk or table, allowing you to perch a CPU on its shelf. So, besides being a cool addition to your home study or work space in the office, this handy device creates more desk space or leg room by putting the CPU out of the way.</p>
