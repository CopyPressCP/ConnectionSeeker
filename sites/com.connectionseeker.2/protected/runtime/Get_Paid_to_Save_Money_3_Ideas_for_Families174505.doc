<p>A lot of money can be saved through couponing. In fact, you can even make money through couponing if you have a good enough strategy. Hundreds of people have actually had stores pay them to buy things. If you don’t believe this, watch an episode of “<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Extreme-Coupon">Extreme Couponing</a>” for proof.</p>
<p>Most retail and grocery stores print weekly ads, and many also accept the coupons of competitors. When you combine store coupons and competitor coupons with manufacturer coupons, you can sometimes get items for free or nearly nothing. On rare occasions, you might even be able to get a store to pay you for an item.</p>
<p>There are also several other <a href="http://coupons.rewardit.com/couponing-strategy/" target="_blank">benefits of a coupon strategy</a>. For instance, it helps you plan the meals that your family will eat each week when you only buy items that you have coupons for. Having a plan when you go to the grocery store will definitely save you money because you won’t buy things that will go unused and become spoiled.</p>
<p>Here are some places to look for coupons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local newspaper</li>
<li>In-store ads</li>
<li>Websites that compile coupons like couponmom.com and thekrazycouponlady.com</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Giving Your Opinion</strong></h2>

<p>Consumer opinions are very important to companies because they help them sell their products better. There are several market research companies that pay people for their opinions. You can participate too by signing up on one of the many survey sites.</p>
<p>Here are some survey sites you can try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge Networks</li>
<li>Survey Monkey</li>
<li>NFO, My Survey</li>
<li>Survey Savvy</li>
</ul>
<p>You can save money by taking survey because you are often rewarded in cash and prizes, and you sometimes might even get coupons or gift cards for retail stores and restaurants. If you like to tell people your opinion, you might as well get paid to do it.</p>
<p>Becoming a mystery shopper is another way to give your opinion, get paid for it, and save money along the way. If you like to shop, you can make money as a mystery shopper. Some companies will pay you to buy items at their store or try food at their restaurant. As a mystery shopper, you will go undercover to a store, purchase a product or try some food at a restaurant, and then return and give your opinion of the experience, like whether the customer service was fast and courteous or whether the location was clean.</p>
<h2><strong>Use a Browser with Rewards</strong></h2>

<p>Another way to save money is to look for good deals on the Internet. You can save money by comparison shopping this way. Plus, some browsers will reward you by offering cashback for your purchases or rewards simply for using their browser. So, why not <a href="http://cashback.rewardit.com/cash-rewards/" target="_blank">treat yourself with cashback rewards</a> for doing things you are doing anyway?</p>
<p>Here are some browsers and toolbars that you can try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swagbucks</li>
<li>Scour</li>
</ul>

<p>Learning to save money is rewarding and it is also easy to incorporate it into your lifestyle. It only takes a little extra time to clip coupons, take surveys, or do comparison shopping on the Internet. Plus, most people do these things anyway, so why not get paid to do it?</p>
