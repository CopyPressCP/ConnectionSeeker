<div><span><strong>Article Content: </strong></span><br /><span><p>When it comes to choosing between a laptop and a ThinkPad, buyers have several factors to consider. Ultimately, though, you should choose the one that matches your needs best.</p>
<h2><strong>Laptop and ThinkPad Aesthetics</strong></h2>

<p>Nearly all ThinkPad products have designs based on Bento lunch boxes. They're small, light, and black. Even the ThinkPad <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/tablet/">tablets</a> look like traditional Japanese lunch boxes. With laptops, though, you can find just about any design that you want. Many companies will even make you a custom laptop that has any kind of graphic that you could ask for.</p>
<p>If you like the traditional aesthetics of the ThinkPad, then you probably think that wildly customized laptops look garish. If you want more variety to choose from, then you should explore laptops to find a design aesthetic that appeals to you.</p>
<h2>Laptop and ThinkPad Audio</h2>

<p>Let's face it: most of the speakers that laptops use don't sound very good. Some models have nice-enough speakers, but their designers choose to install them on the laptop's base. That muffles the sound.</p>
<p>The ThinkPad has its speakers on top, so you don't have to worry about muffled sounds. In most cases, the ThinkPad sounds better than the average PC. With the ThinkPad, though, you don't get much variety. If you want custom speakers, then you will have to replace the ThinkPad's or plug a speaker set into the computer's headphone jack.</p>
<h2>Laptop and ThinkPad Performance</h2>

<p>Once you get them booted, laptops and ThinkPads have similar performance rates. Users probably wouldn't notice much of a difference if they switched from one to the other.</p>
<p>They would, however, notice that the ThinkPad boots faster than the average laptop. If you hate waiting for a computer to boot, then you will appreciate the time that ThinkPad saves you.</p>
<p>Again, though, you don't have as many options with ThinkPad. They work very well, but you could find a high-range laptop that could outcompete it. That laptop would just cost a lot more money.</p>
<h2>Laptop and ThinkPad Software</h2>

<p>You can always update your software to fit your needs, so let's focus on what comes with laptops and ThinkPads.</p>
<p>The typical laptop comes with the latest version of Windows. It might also have some basic Microsoft Office programs. Other than that, though, you have to pay for more software.</p>
<p>ThinkPad is the clear winner when it comes to software. ThinkVantage Tools makes it easy to take control of the computer's every aspect, including Internet connection and power management. You can even backup and restore the system without needing a degree in computer science. Lenovo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage">Cloud Storage</a> and Solutions for Small Business help put the ThinkPad over the top in this area.</p>
<h2>Which is Best: The Laptop or ThinkPad</h2>

<p>Both options have their own advantages and disadvantages. If you really want to know which one suits you best, spend some time using both to decide which one feels more intuitive to your needs.</p></span></div></body></html>
