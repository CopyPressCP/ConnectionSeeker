<p>Compatible with Windows computers, this simple program tracks your IP address and sends you an email when it changes. You can then take the information you receive in the email, which includes the new IP address, to the police and they can use it hopefully find your stolen laptop. Another thing you can do is use sites that will show you where that IP address is located so you can try and find the laptop yourself.</p>
<h2>Prey</h2>

<p>Prey is an application that can be used on phones, laptops and tablets, including <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/tablet/thinkpad/thinkpad-tablet">light and compact Android tablets</a>. There is a free version as well as a paid pro version depending on your needs. Basically, with this software, you can remotely find the location of your device as well as do things like sound alarms, enable the camera, and send a message that will pop up on the screen.</p>
<p>This program not only will assist you in finding your stolen laptop, tablet or phone, but it can also assist police in doing the same, including grabbing a picture of the person holding your device if it has a camera or webcam. To protect your information on the device, whether an Android tablet or laptop, there are features that include fully locking down the device so it can't do anything, getting a screenshot of what the thief is doing on your device, and removing any saved passwords from the device. </p>
<p>Because you can set an option to connect to the closest Wi-Fi hotspots, the device can connect even if the thief is trying to hide it from you. Overall, it's a great option for those wanting to protect their devices from thieves.</p>
<h2>LoJack for Laptops</h2>

<p>What program you decide on will depend on what features you are looking for. If your laptop or tablet has a lot of sensitive information that you can't afford to lose, then LoJack might be the right service. If you just want something simple that you can use to find your device if it's taken, more than likely Prey will be everything you need.</p>
<p>Even if you think there's absolutely no chance of your laptop or tablet being stolen, take a few minutes and install one of these programs on your computer. You never know if you'll need it one day.</p>
