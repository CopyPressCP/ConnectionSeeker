<div><span><strong>Article Content: </strong></span><br /><span><p>Beyond the superficial coolness of tablets, these bad boys pack some serious punch in some very practical ways. Check out these six amazing ways tablets are changing people’s lives and empowering users to try new things.</p>
<h2>Accept Credit Card Payments</h2>

<p>Aspiring artists, local craftspeople, and street vendors have lost countless dollars over the decades because they could only take cash or checks. Enter the tablet with some amazing business apps and hardware add-ons. Point-of-sale apps and devices such as Intuit GoPayment and PaymentMax allow sellers to swipe credit cards anywhere in the world. In some cases, the apps even offer other business services such as tallying and tracking sales.</p>
<h2>Create Music</h2>

<p>Professional musicians, 2-year-olds who like to make noise, and everyone in between can satisfy their creative urges with a tablet. While a <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/laptop/ultrabook/">reliable Ultrabook</a> may be necessary when it’s time to do some hardcore music composition or collaboration, tablets make it possible to “fiddle around” with different sounds and styles. Apps such as Groovebox, G-Stomper, and JCI Piano Chords transform tablets into instruments. Whether the goal is to learn music basics, experiment, or just goof around with some fun sounds, the tablet can fill the air with your music.</p>
<h2>Work as a Teleprompter</h2>

<p>Tablets allow would-be politicians to enjoy the benefits of a teleprompter. Whether it’s a campaign for statewide office or PTA president, candidates typically have to give speeches. Prompster Pro, iQPrompter, and Orator apps vary in price and added features, though all offer basic teleprompter functions. Use these apps to avoid the embarrassment of discovering as you walk to the podium that your note cards are in another pair of pants.</p>
<h2>Edit Audio</h2>

<p>Develop, produce, and distribute podcasts or radio content using a tablet. While smartphones can record audio, they’re too small for editing audio. The tablet solves this problem by offering a screen that is the perfect size and editing apps such as Reforge.</p>
<h2>Display a Menu</h2>

<p>Think meals should be the one time when everyone puts away their devices (or at least hides them under the table)? A handful of big city restaurants are tinkering with letting diners peruse menus and place orders on tablets. Fad du jour or a lasting innovation?  Only time will tell.</p>
<h2>Teach Kids Letters and Numbers</h2>

<p>Tablets capitalize on what savvy teachers have always known: Kids learn concepts fastest through playing games. Sit children down to recite the ABCs and you’ll soon have a room full of bored kids. But crank up fun, educational apps such as Kids ABC Phonics, Magnetic Alphabet, and Alpha Writer by Montessorium will engage kids and help them learn to read.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Though tablets have that sexy vibe, it’s clear that they’re more than just something hip to whip out while you wait for your flight. There are so many ways tablets can improve business, education, the creative arts, and many other areas of society. What are some of the amazing ways a tablet has changed your life?</p>
